###Overview: CDA On FHIR England - Document Header#

**Background**

The design of the CDA On FHIR England (COFE) - Document Header is based on the C-CDA on FHIR US Realm Header profile "ccda-us-realm-header-composition".

This is a generic Composition profile (equivalent to a Level 2 CDA document) that defines constraints that represent common administrative and demographic concepts for NHS clinical documents. It will be used to link to COFE document type profiles created for any coded entries that would normally be included in traditional CDA sections (equivalent to Level 3 CDA entries). The COFE document type profiles should conform to this profile.

**Further Information**

This FHIR Document specification is based on and intended to be used alongside the published [FHIR DSTU2 1.0.1] (October 2015) specification.
